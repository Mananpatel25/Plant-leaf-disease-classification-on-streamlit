# Plant-leaf-disease-classification-on-streamlit
A Deep learning project comprising of deployment of image classification models trained on Plant leaves dataset of Mango and Potato and then further deployed on Streamlit.
The Dataset was imported from Kaggle repository on Plant Village dataset, Mango dataset had total 4000 images from 8 classes and Tomato had total 10000 images from 10 classes. 
Various Pre-trained models were used from deep learning like InceptiionV3, Xception and CNN Baseline model in addition. Then the models were integrated in a web app for a User Interface using Streamlit -  A framework using Python. 
TWO PLANTS WERE TAKEN INTO  CONSIDERATION - MANGO AND TOMATO. User can select either of plant from sidebar for prediction.
BELOW IS A DEMO PIC FROM APP OF PREDICTION
